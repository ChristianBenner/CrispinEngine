# CrispinEngine
CrispinEngine is a 2D game engine that features fast drawing, simple audio, a simple particle engine and some other useful developer tools. In the future I plan CrispinEngine to become more simple to use, and include a better audio engine. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions to the project.

# GameTemplate
A simple template that any programmer can use to begin using CrispinEngine for 2D games. The template includes comments and simple notation.

A readme will be added soon with some documentation and usage on the engine. For now please try to use the GameTemplate solution/code to understand how to use the engine, thanks!
